 ## Problems with video editing:
If you have a video that includes unwanted noise, extra audio, or unnecessary elements, you'll need to remove them during the editing process.
    
**Here are two tips to help you with that:**

1.  **Remove noise from the video:** You can use the free software Audacity ([https://www.audacityteam.org/](https://www.audacityteam.org/)) to remove any noise from the video.
    
2.  **Separate video and audio:** If the audio in your video is unclear or you need to add a separate audio track, you can separate the video and audio using the online video editor WeVideo ([https://www.wevideo.com/](https://www.wevideo.com/)). The software allows you to export both the audio and video separately.

 6. To edit a video, we need to listen to it carefully and cut out any unnecessary parts. We can do this by observing the video while it plays and taking note of the time stamps for the parts we want to remove. We need to repeat this process for the entire video to ensure that it is edited correctly.
