# 10 Important features of PowerPoint that everyone needs to know


### Let’s explore all the advanced feature from each tab

## **Home**

1.  When you have a list of images and bullet points in a slide, and you want to align them to right or left,
    

-   You can either do it manually, but then there will be a doubt whether they are really aligned or not,
    
-   In that case you can use a wonderful feature called **Align** which is in **Home** tab (Drawing group position object section)
    
-   If you want all the bullet points or text to start from the left/right side, keeping the first bullet point/text as a reference, then
    
-   Select all the bullets/text, go to the 
-**Home tab>Arrange option>Align section>click on align left/right.**
    
-   Then all the text/image will be aligned exactly from the left/right side.
    

2. To distribute images/ texts/ bullet points equally either horizontally or vertically, then

-   Select all the bullets/images/texts, go to the 
-**Home tab>Arrange option>Align section>click on Distribute Vertically/Distribute Horizontally**
    
    -   Then all the text/image will be aligned with the same spacing by taking the first and last objects as reference.
        

3. To make a number of slides about a particular topic into a group,

-   You can do it using **add Section** feature in PowerPoint.
    
-   Click on the particular slide where you want to start the grouping from.
    
-   Click on **Home tab>Section>Add section** option
    
-   A popup will appear for the name of that section, give the name as per the requirement,
    
-   New section is inserted in the thumbnails section of your PowerPoint.
    

## **Insert**

1.  Now you have understood how to **add sections**, next we are learning how to use those sections.
    
2.  If we have 3 sections in our presentation and we want to make the 3rd section play after the first one,
    

-   We can do it by selecting the **Insert tab>Links group>Zoom option**
    
-   Click on **Section zoom**, and choose the **section number** you want to play here it’s 3rd section, it will be inserted as a **link** to your slide,
    
-   You can change the picture of the link by right clicking on it and selecting **change picture** option.
    
-   When you play the presentation on slideshow mode, just click on the **zoom link**, it will take you to the 3rd section directly and once the section is over, you will be reverted back to the first section slide.
    

3. We mostly insert images in our presentation, and to insert videos to your presentation

-   Go to **insert tab>click on video> choose from your device or the stock videos available in the presentation.**
    
-   To trim the video, go to **Playback tab>Trim video**, give the start and end time for the video, then the PowerPoint will provide you the required portion.
    

## **Design**

1.  Mostly we use the Default slide size given in the PowerPoint
    
2.  But we can also modify to the required slide size in **Design tab>Slide size option**
    
3.  We can choose either **4:3 or 16:9** here
    
4.  Click on ‘**custom slide size**’ to adjust **width** and **Height** and **type of orientation.**
    

## **Transitions**

1.  Transitions are used for smooth shift between slides
    
2.  We use **Morph transition** to show movement of a particular object from one slide to another
    
3.  For example, if you have same image in the top left corner of slide1 and at the bottom left corner of slide2, then applying Morph transition will allow smooth movement of the image from its location in slide 1 to its location in slide 2.
    

## **Animations**

1.  We know how to apply animation to an object, now i’m explaining about the **Animation pane**,
    

-   Select **Animation** tab and click on **Animation pane**
    
-   To the right side of the presentation, we’ll get the list of animation applied in that particular slide
    
-   To do modifications to the applied animations, **drag and drop** that animation below the desired animation number
    
-   For ex, if we want the 4th animation to be played with 1st one, just drag that 4th animation in the animation pane and drop it below the 1st animation and then right click and choose ‘**Start with previous**’.
    

2. To apply **Play/Pause/Stop** animation to videos,

-   Select the video
    
-   Go to **Animation** tab,
    
-   Choose **play/pause/stop**
    
-   In animation pane, move it to the required position.
    

3. ‘**Start after previous**’ is used to play an animation after the previous animation is over.

## **View**

1.  To add a particular design to all the slides in a ppt, we can use ‘**slide master**’ feature from **View** tab.
    

-   Click on **slide master** option, if you have a design in another ppt, you can simply copy that and paste it in the master slide, it will apply the same design to the entire ppt, you can also make changes to them by checking each slide.
    

2. In the **View** tab, we have **Ruler**, **Gridlines**, **Guides**

-   If you click on Ruler, it will turn on a scale which can be used to locate the exact position.
    
-   Gridlines will turn on a graph on you presentation.
    
-   Guides will turn on the X,Y coordinates on the slide.
