# Technical audio recording - guidelines



1.  Meaning of punctuation:
    
    -   Comma (,) - take a small pause.
    -   Double comma (,,) - take a longer pause.
    -   Full stop (.) - Take a littler longer pause than double comma.
    -   Words within quotes ("") - all words together without break.
    -   Words with hyphens (-) - all words together without break.
    -   Words in square brackets ([]) - These are emotions. For eg. Chuckle, smile, sad tone, happy tone, excited.
2.  Tips:
    
    1.  If there is a mistake in saying a word/sentence, just repeat the sentence without pausing the audio. Later it will be removed during editing. But make a rough note of the timestamp.
    2.  Record in Audacity software for each editing later.
    3.  Record with good quality mic.
    4.  Make sure there are no noises around during the recording.
3.  Post-recording cleanup:
    
    -   Remove wrong words/sentences wherever marked.
4.  Recording Setup:
    
    1.  Laptop
    2.  Audacity software
    3.  Notepad++ to keep the transcript
    4.  [https://www.timeanddate.com/stopwatch/](https://www.timeanddate.com/stopwatch/) website.
5.  Recording & submission guidelines (should be followed by the person doing the recording):
    
    -   Read the transcript loudly at least twice before starting the recording.
    -   Read the punctuation guidelines before starting recording.
    -   All punctuation guidelines MUST be followed.
    -   Sentences should be EXACTLY as they are in the transcript.
    -   Words should be smooth flowing, without jerks.
    -   Use the website to mark the timestamps where errors occurred. Later remove the error clips.
    -   After recording is done, save the original file.
    -   Perform a quick noise cancellation on the original recording.
    -   Cut the clips that need to be removed as per the stopwatch marks.
    -   After all the clean up is done, give your recording a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 on the following parameters:
        -   Sounds like a human.
        -   Sounds like a robot.
        -   Fumbling of words/sentences.
        -   Punctuation as per transcript.
        -   Enthusiasm in reading.
        -   Overall how much do you like this recording.
    -   Submit the recording for approval.
    -   If approved by the quality team, this recording is considered a successful recording.
    -   Else, modifications need to be done based on Quality Team's recommendations.
6.  Other points:
    
    -   New line in transcript does not mean pause. So don't take pauses at new lines. Cross over to a new line smoothly.
    -   Do not record more than 10 minutes in one go. It sounds robotic.
