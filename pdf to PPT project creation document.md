📖 Check the page number of the particular component in the PDF file, copy all the text from that page, and paste it at the same position in the animation PPT file.

💻 Change the font size, style, and color to the approved template format.

🎨 Next, go to the source PPT file and check the slide number of the component. Copy all the images from that slide and paste them into the animation PPT file at the same position.

✂️ Remove any extra spaces that may have come in between the words.

👍 Repeat this process for all the components.
