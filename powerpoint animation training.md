## Animation Vs Transition
### Animation PPTx creation workflow
1.  Task: Watch the video (@pravalika should not watch this video)
    
    -   Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlsBLMw7VGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlsBLMw7VGE)
    -   Draw and record the architecture by hand (sheet by sheet)
    -   Tear A4 sheets into halves and number them
    -   Number each half sheet in the left top corner and make sure it's clearly visible in the video when starting each half sheet
    -   Use numbers to represent images instead of actually drawing images
    -   Create a Google Sheet where each image number on the video drawing corresponds to an image so the animator can pick the correct image
    -   Use a proper stand to hold the mobile to record things
    -   Upload the video to the vimeo 01-to-be-processed folder and post the link here
2.  Task: Create 2 PPTs with the following names:
    
    -   vid001-istio-architecture-instructions.pptx
    -   vid001-istio-architecture-animation.pptx
    -   Share both PPTs
3.  Task: Write the instructions for the first two slides and confirm with @pravalika so she can start working
    
4.  Task: Finish the instructions for the rest of the slides and confirm with @pravalika
    
5.  Task: @pravalika will finish draft1 (just draft, not perfect) of all the slides by around 2 PM and update for review
    
6.  Task: While reviewing, @pravalika will continue with the improvements
    
7.  Task: @pravalika to finish the animation by 4 PM
    
    -   If there are any doubts or if the instructions are not clear, she has to put them in comments on the instructions PPTX and ping @Sathish.J
8.  Task: At 4 PM, submit the final animation PPT for final review by @Sathish.J
    
9.  Task: By 4:30 PM, @Sathish.J will provide modifications or final approval
    
    -   If approved, by 5:30 PM add the template and upload to YouTube by 6 PM.
