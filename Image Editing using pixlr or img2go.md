👉 If you resize the images, then click on the "resize" button. Otherwise, click on "ignore". 

🕰️ If you want to change the delay for all frames, you can go to "delay time", change the value, and it will reset the delay for all frames. 

🌟 Select "Gravity" (alignment), choose your option, and click it. Then, go to "Effects", choose and select it, and after that, click on the "Make a GIF!" button. 

⏭️ If you want to change the animation speed proportionally to the current animation, use "% of current speed" from the drop-down. Entering 200% will make the animation run 2x faster, 50% will cause it to slow down 2x. Slowing down a GIF too much may cause it to lose smoothness. 

🖼️ If you want to manually enter different delays for specific frames or remove some frames altogether, you can do it in our GIF maker. Split the image and click the "Edit animation" button. Wait for a moment. Finally, we get the video. Then, you can download it to your system.
