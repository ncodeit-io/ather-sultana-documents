### Animation Vs Transition

### Animation PPTx creation workflow

-   Watch the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlsBLMw7VGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlsBLMw7VGE) (excluding @pravalika)
-   Draw and record the architecture by hand on A4 sheets, each sheet numbered with slide number in left top corner.
-   Use numbers to represent images and create a corresponding gsheet.
-   Upload the video to vimeo 01-to-be-processed folder and post the link.
-   Create two PPTs: vid001-istio-architecture-instructions.pptx and vid001-istio-architecture-animation.pptx and share both.
-   Write instructions for first two slides and confirm with @pravalika to start.
-   Finish instructions for the remaining slides and confirm with @pravalika.
-   @pravalika to finish draft1 of all slides by 2 PM and update for review.
-   Review and provide feedback while @pravalika continues improvements.
-   @pravalika to finish animation by 4 PM, asking for clarifications or doubts in comments on instructions pptx and pinging @Sathish.J.
-   Submit final animation ppt for final review by 4 PM, with modifications or final approval given by 4:30 PM.
-   Add template and upload to YouTube by 6 PM.

### Steps for creating animation ppts from existing videos
| Step | Task                                   |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | Watch the video                        |
| 2    | Roughly draft animations for all slides|
| 3    | Create video for first 50% of slides    |
| 4    | Create instructions for static slides of first 50% |
| 5    | Create animation instructions for static slides of first 50% |
| 6    | Create animation for first 50% of slides |
| 7    | Create video for last 50% of slides |
| 8    | Create instructions for static slides of last 50% |
| 9    | Create animation instructions for static slides of last 50% |
| 10   | Create animation for last 50% of slides |
| 11   | Review and finalize |
| 12   | Apply thumbnail template |
| 13   | Upload to YouTube |

### General Guidelines / Recommendations:

-   Decide at the beginning whether to use a light or dark background for the animation.
-   While recording the initial hand-drawn video, draw in landscape mode to match the slides.
-   After recording, check that the direction of drawing and recording are aligned properly. Use VLC player or other tools to correct the direction before uploading to Vimeo.
-   Instructions for a slide should not go beyond that slide number to avoid confusing the animation creator.
-   If there are too many instructions for a single slide, divide it into two slides. Plan this in the video to avoid cramming too much content into one slide.
-   Redraw part of one slide into the next slide to keep the number of instructions limited.

### Instructions to get the animation from existing images

| Stage | Task                                                                                         |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Give a cut wise numbers to static image send to trainer for review and recommendations      |
| 2     | Cut the images into different parts as per trainer recommendations and convert to vector    |
|       | image format, upload the images to any drive and create gsheet and put the details of images |
|       | code wise                                                                                     |
| 3     | Get instruction from trainer to re-arrange the image, use the ppt and rearrange image based   |
|       | on trainer instructions, send to trainer for review.                                          |
| 4     | Get the audio record and animation instruction from trainer and apply animation to re-      |
|       | arranged image and send for review to trainer.                                                |
| 5     | Do the pre and post production works and upload to YouTube.                                   |


### Marking of Images - General Guidelines 

There are 4 different categories of marking.
- **1txt** - Marking of text - in RED color boxes . With 1A,1B, 1C, 1D . …. all starting with 1  
- **2img** - Marking of images - in GREEN color boxes . With 2A,2B,2C,2D …. all starting with 2  
- **3tximg** - Marking of text + images - in BLUE color boxes - with 3A,3B,3C,3D … all starting with 3  
- **4logi** - Marking of Logical Blocks - in YELLOW color boxes - with 4A,4B,4C,4D … all starting with 4

Apart from this each slide will have the category of marking at the top right corner of that slide.

When marking a new image, we have to copy the correct slide and then insert the image into the slide , then start the marking .

> A video of how to do these markings is available at -

### Using Professional Powerpoint templates and InfoGraphics

Professional Powerpoint templates pre-created templates by good designers that we can use to enhance the look and feel of our ppt.

Check out [https://graphicriver.net/popular_item/by_category?category=presentation-templates%2Fpowerpoint-templates&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_qD_BRDiARIsANjZ2LDqrlBXPiREMU1vqQDxkLj0xUK6O0IJSRYwcBqDcuak-CMFg8Ns0dEaAlMbEALw_wcB](https://graphicriver.net/popular_item/by_category?category=presentation-templates%2Fpowerpoint-templates&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_qD_BRDiARIsANjZ2LDqrlBXPiREMU1vqQDxkLj0xUK6O0IJSRYwcBqDcuak-CMFg8Ns0dEaAlMbEALw_wcB "https://graphicriver.net/popular_item/by_category?category=presentation-templates%2Fpowerpoint-templates&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_qD_BRDiARIsANjZ2LDqrlBXPiREMU1vqQDxkLj0xUK6O0IJSRYwcBqDcuak-CMFg8Ns0dEaAlMbEALw_wcB")

They are basically slides that we can

> -   copy the slides from template to our own PPT file
>     
> -   modify the pre-created slides slightly to convert into what we need for our own PPT
>     
> -   infographics (arrows,boxes,banners etc ) that we can copy/paste into our own PPT

- We have already purchased the following 2 bundles for our internal use. Check the the project manager for to copy this into your own laptop
