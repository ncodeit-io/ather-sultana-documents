# How to Create a Transcript in Word and Slack for Audio

Creating a transcript for an audio file can be a time-consuming task. Here are two methods to help you quickly create transcripts:

## Using MS Word

1.  Download the audio file from the Vimeo URL column.
    
2.  Open **Microsoft Word Online** in Chrome and create a blank document. Dictation is only available online, not in the offline version.
    
3.  Click on the microphone icon to access the dictation feature.
    
4.  Select "Transcribe" and upload the audio file.
    
5.  Once uploaded, choose "Just Text" and the document will open. Copy and paste the text into the original transcript column of the Recording Instruction Sheet in the required component tracker.
    

## Using Slack

1.  Download the audio file.
    
2.  Open the Slack application and upload or send the audio file to anyone.
    
3.  The transcript will be automatically generated and displayed below the audio file. Click on "View Transcript" to view the transcript.
    
4.  Copy the transcript and paste it into the required location.
