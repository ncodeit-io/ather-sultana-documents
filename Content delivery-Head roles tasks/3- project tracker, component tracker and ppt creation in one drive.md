**Ppt creation:**

-   Create a power point presentation files for recreate the video content of the sprints of project.
    
      -> In this you have to open one drive then go to projects then go to your    sprint which ever is given to you if your sprint component id is not there in   that then you have to create a folder by clicking on New.
    
      -> Then in that you have to create individual trackers for your sprint by clicking on new then in that you have to create ppt's for component every component should have 3 ppt's.
   
      -> One for screen shot ppt - rename it as ppt name following with component id.
    
    ex: _01-Scrsht-pr56sp01-07_  
    --One for marking ppt - rename it as ppt name following with component id.
    
    ex: _02-mrkScrSht-pr56sp01-07_  
    -- One for animation ppt - rename it as ppt name following with component id.
    
    ex: _03-Animat-pr56sp01-07_
