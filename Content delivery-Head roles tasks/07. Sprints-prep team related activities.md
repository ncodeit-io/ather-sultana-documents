# _**Sprint-Prep-Checklist:**_

 -   Sprint approvals team will work on creating a pool of approved sprints. Other content-delivery teams will pick up approved sprints from this pool
    
 -   List of activities - in the same order - for `sprints-prep` team
 
		-    create a project tracker
        
      -   Extract source-title, source-URL, and length-of-video and send it for select/reject_for_extraction
        
          1. We need to watch the video, while watching the video topics changed for a few slides we need to take the time stamp after one topic completed  

          2. We can identify the topics with heading, main titles  
         
          3. The minimum duration of the split video is 10 minutes (10 minutes approx)  .Each video should not be more than 15 minutes, Exactly 10 minutes is not required. don't split the video less than 9 to 10 minutes. don't split the video more than15 minutes  
	        4. List out the timestamps and split the video into small parts based on that timestamps  
	        5. After splitting the video we need to upload those videos to vimeo.After uploading take the url and upload to the  tracker sheet in i columnVimeoo url) .
	        
		        Here is  the project tracker sheet

        **RESTRICTED CONTENT**
        
          6. Divide the components into 30 minute sprints
        
          7. Parallelly, extract the video and upload to vimeo

**Create tracker sheets :**
1. We need to create the individual tracker sheet for each video we have divided  in Step 1 

	-  After the  creation of the PPT's make sure to update those into individual trackers 
 
2. We have the tracker sheet template take a copy from that  here is the template URL

 ## Create PPTs :

 - First, create ppts with the  following names,Each video should have the component id like` projectid-sprintid-01, 02,03 etc.`

			  
	 - _01-Scrsht-<componentID):_	    
	 - _02-mrkScrSht-<componentID>_ 
	 - _03-Animat-<componentID>_

 - After the ppt creation rename with component id and update the URLs inthe  trackers sheet.
   
- Check whether the url's of each ppt is updated in each component tracker or not and project tracker too.

 - Take the screenshots

	1.  Check all the screenshots by watching Vimeo video - all screenshots are there or not, is there any unnecessary screenshots are there, and check the naming of each screenshot whether is in order or not.

	    -   compute the estimates and send for approval
        
	    -   create the component trackers under the approved gdrive account. Update urls of all the components in in sub-sheet `DD` - of `` `prxx-project-tracker-vxx` ``
        
      -   update column `is transcript extracted?` to `no`
