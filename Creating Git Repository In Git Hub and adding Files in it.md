# Creating Git Repository In Git Hub and adding Files in it:

Step-by-Step procedure to create a Git repository in GitHub:

1.  **Sign in to your GitHub account:** 
- To create a Git repository on GitHub, you first need to sign in to your GitHub account. 
- If you do not have an account yet, you can create one by clicking on the "Sign up" button on the GitHub homepage. 
- Here's a link to the GitHub homepage where you can sign up for an account: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
    
2.  **Click on the "+" icon:** 
- Once you have signed in, click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the screen. 
- This will open a drop-down menu.
    
3.  **Select "New repository":** 
- From the drop-down menu, select "New repository." 
- This will take you to the "Create a new repository" page.
    
4.  **Enter a name for your repository:** 
- On the "Create a new repository" page, enter a name for your repository in the "Repository name" field. 
- This name should be unique and descriptive so that others can easily understand what your repository is about. 
- You can also add a short description of your repository in the "Description" field.
    
5.  **Choose whether you want your repository to be public or private:** 
- You can choose whether you want your repository to be public or private. 
- Public repositories are visible to anyone on GitHub, while private repositories are only visible to you and any collaborators you invite.
    
6.  **Select whether you want to initialize your repository with a README file:** 
- You can choose whether you want to initialize your repository with a README file. 
- A README file is a text file that provides a brief overview of your project, and it is often the first thing visitors see when they visit your repository's homepage.
    
7.  **Choose a license for your repository:** 
- You can choose a license for your repository. 
- A license is a legal agreement that determines the terms under which others can use and modify your code. 
- Choosing a license is important if you plan to share your code with others.
    
8.  **Click on the "Create repository" button:** 
- Once you have filled in all the necessary details, click on the "Create repository" button to create your repository. 

9.  **Add files to your repository:** 
- Now that your repository is created, you can add files to it. 
- You can either upload files directly to GitHub or use Git to push your files to the repository. 
- First, navigate to your repository on GitHub.
- Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files" or "Create new file" depending on whether you want to upload existing files or create new ones.
- If you choose to upload files, you can drag and drop the files into the designated area or click on the "choose your files" button to browse and select files from your computer.
- If you choose to create a new file, enter the file name followed by .md (filename.md) and contents in the text editor provided.
- Once you have added the files, you can preview the changes by clicking on the "Preview changes" tab. Here, you can review the changes you've made to the files. 
- When you're ready to commit the changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter a commit message in the "Commit changes" section. 
- The commit message should be a brief description of the changes you've made.
- Click on the "Commit changes" button to commit the changes to your Git repository on GitHub.
    
17.  **Invite collaborators:** If you want to collaborate with others on your project, you can invite them to your repository. You can do this by going to the "Settings" tab of your repository and clicking on the "Collaborators" option. From there, you can add collaborators by entering their GitHub usernames or email addresses.
