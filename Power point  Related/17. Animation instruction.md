# Animation instruction

To provide animation instructions in G blocks, follow the steps below:

1.  Access the project's tracker sheet. Each project has a separate tracker sheet.
2.  Go to the **Animation Instructions** subsheet in the tracker sheet.
3.  Update all the columns with the necessary information, including:
    -   **Slide ID:** Enter the slide ID in which the animation will be applied.
    -   **On Object:** Specify whether the animation will be applied to text or an image.
    -   **Perform Animation:** Enter the type of animation you want to apply, such as fade, appear, wipe, split, exit, or add.
    -   **To Location:** Block the s numbers like G1, G2â€¦ where the animation will be applied.

Here's an example of a tracker sheet that you can refer to for better understanding: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ErTrTYA2g-HhN6s1PCu8J5xjOIAGPIBZ-tFGQyTBhm0/edit#gid=820646723](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ErTrTYA2g-HhN6s1PCu8J5xjOIAGPIBZ-tFGQyTBhm0/edit#gid=820646723)

Make sure to update the tracker sheet with the animation instructions and keep it up-to-date.
