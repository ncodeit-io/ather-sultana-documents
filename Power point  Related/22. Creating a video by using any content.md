# Creating a Video by Using Any Content

This guide outlines the steps involved in creating a video using any content, including key points and images related to that content. The following steps should be followed in order to create a successful video:

**1**.  **Screenshot:** Take the content from the provided PDF and arrange the text in a screenshot PowerPoint (PPT).
    
**2**.  **Marking:** Insert the contents in the screenshot PPT into the marking PPT by dividing it into 4 categories - text template (1txt), image template (2img), text+image template (3txtimg), and logical template (4log).
    
**3**.  **Cutting:** Crop the images related to the content using Gyazo or Pixlr and place them in the screenshot PPT.
    
**4**.  **Creating Transcript:**
    
-   Creating Transcript in Word:
    -   Download the required video from Vimeo.
    -   Open an online MS Word in Chrome and open a blank document.
    -   Click on the dictate option in the microphone symbol and then click on transcribe option and upload the required video.
    -   After uploading, select the document and choose the option JUST TEXT.
    -   Copy and paste the matter in the original transcript column of the recording instruction sheet in the required component tracker.
-   Creating Transcript in Slack:
    -   Upload the audio file to Slack.
    -   The transcription takes a little time for the audio length file to transcribe a file completely.
    -   Screenshot by Gyazo.
    -   Copy the text and paste the matter in the original transcript column of the recording instruction sheet in the required component tracker.

**5**.  **Image Insert Instruction:** Insert the content and images into the animation PPT for image insert instructions, using the generic template. Create image-insertion instructions in the Google  Sheets tracker, providing instructions for the source PowerPoint slide, slide ID, operation, object, target slide ID, and location.
    
**6**.  **Image Insertion:** Insert the images into the animation PPT as per the image insert instruction sheet.
    
**7**.  **Creating Audio for the Transcript:** Use Audacity or Blaster to record the audio for the given transcript.
    
**8**.  **Animation Instructions:** Provide the animation instructions in Google Sheets, updating the slide ID, on object, perform animation, and to location columns.
    
**9**.  **Animation Timestamps:**
    
-   Prepare the base transcripts and put the transcripts in the recording-instructions sheet.
-   After done the original transcript, add the animation timestamp based on the video and transcript.
-   Note the time whenever the text appears, such as 00:00:10.
-   Enter the recording instructions in the recording-instr subsheet.

**10**.  **Animation Timestamps Calculations:** Take the slide transition time based on each slide and use the formula to calculate the timestamps based on the audio/video file. Enter the results in the calculation sheet.

**11. Animation apply:**

1.  Here apply the animation by giving the animation timestamps to the content and images in animation ppt.
    
2.  Once the animation apply is done for all the content in PPT check once by doing slide show.
    

**12. Exporting the video:**

1.  Go to file option in the animation ppt and click export option.
    
2.  Choose the video resolution.
    
3.  Change the Seconds spent on each slide to 01.00.
    
4.  Click on create video, save it in your system.
    
5.  Wait until the exporting finishes.
