# Sprint preparation


### Split the video into small parts and upload it to Vimeo:
The first step for sprint preparation is to split the video into small parts :
1. We need to watch the video, while watching the video topics changed for a few slides we need to take the time stamp after one topic completed  

2. We can identify the topics with heading, main titles  

3. The minimum duration of the split video is 10 minutes (10 minutes approx). Each video should not be more than 15 minutes, Exactly 10 minutes is not required. Don't split the video less than 9 to 10 minutes, and don't split the video more than 15 minutes

4. List out the timestamps and split the video into small parts based on that timestamps  

5. After splitting the video we need to upload those videos to Vimeo, after uploading take the URL and upload it to the tracker sheet in the I column(Vimeo URL).
Here is the project tracker sheet

**RESTRICTED CONTENT**  
# Create tracker sheets:

1. We need to create the individual tracker sheet for each video we have divided in Step 1  

2. We have the tracker sheet template take a copy from that,
Here is the template URL

  
![](https://developers.google.com/drive/images/drive_icon.png)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1842-LOjBXeFjqqBKf7AuVre6v98oXQJGfnie1olx7cY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1842-LOjBXeFjqqBKf7AuVre6v98oXQJGfnie1olx7cY/edit#gid=0)
**RESTRICTED CONTENT**

NOTE: do not edit the template take a copy of the template  

3. After copying the template we need to rename the tracker sheet name with the video title name and update the component id in the tracker sheet.

4.Give the edit access to [ncodeitalwvqa@gmail.com](mailto:ncodeitalwvqa@gmail.com "mailto:ncodeitalwvqa@gmail.com") to tracker sheet  
  
## Create PPTs:  
1. We need to create the ppt for screenshots, marking, and animation ppt under project recreation only and create the ppts for all videos.Here is the location(take the logins from login sheet)  
[https://onedrive.live.com/?id=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD%21756&cid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD](https://onedrive.live.com/?id=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD%21756&cid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD) - Connect your OneDrive account  

First, create ppts with the following names, Each video should have the component id like` projectid-sprintid-01, 02,03 etc.`  
_01-Scrsht-<componentID):_  
_02-mrkScrSht-<componentID>_  
_03-Animat-<componentID>_  
after the ppt creation rename with component id and update the URLs in the tracker's sheet  
  
## Google Photos saving process:  
1. Open particular album in [ncdjspics@gmail.com](mailto:ncdjspics@gmail.com "mailto:ncdjspics@gmail.com")

2. Save all the photos to [ncdjspics@gmail.com](mailto:ncdjspics@gmail.com "mailto:ncdjspics@gmail.com") by clicking on **save photos** button at the top right corner.

3. Go back to albums search recently added and check the names of the images and then select all the images related to that component(select all images at once by clicking on 1st image, hold the shift button scroll down then select the last image while holding the shift).  

4. Click on the **plus** button at the top right corner, select an album, find the album name of that component in the list of albums, select that album than all the selected images will be moved to that album.

5. Open that album and check whether all the images are added or not in StackEdit (https://stackedit.io/).
