### 📷 Screenshots

👉 Will take the screenshots and upload that screenshots to particular component id location in google photos (ncdjspics@gmail.com)
👉 We need to create the tracker sheet in below location: 
   https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/12_qozROi63p6JBIiqUrS7e7stAO67w78 📂 (RESTRICTED CONTENT)

👉 Will take the screenshots and upload that screenshots to particular component id location in google photos (ncdjspics@gmail.com)

🎥 In source video we have to take the screenshots:

1. To take screenshots we can press the (windows +PrtSc) on the keyboard.
2. We can repeat the process until the video is finished.
3. These screenshots are then uploaded to the Google Photos (ncdjspics@gmail.com).

🔍 We have to take screenshots as per component ID ending with serial no., then upload them to Google Photos.
4. Those screenshots have to be inserted in PowerPoint (SC ppt). 💻

### 🎯 Marking

👉 From the full list of screenshots, filter out only those screenshots that are needed for marking.

👉 Mark 4 categories of objects in the screenshots:

1. From the full list of screenshots, filter out only those screenshots that are needed for marking.
2. Mark 4 categories of objects in the screenshots.
3. We have to use the generic template for marking. Here's the generic template link: https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?cid=1d5fee4885b5afbd&page=view&resid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!758&parId=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!756&app=PowerPoint - Connect your OneDrive account.
4. Each screenshot can be inserted into four templates: text template (1txt), image template (2img), text+image template (3txtimg), and logical template (4log).

📝 In text slide (1txt), we have to mark only texts.

📷 In image slide (2imgslide), we have to mark only images.

📝📷 In text+image slide (3txtimg), we have to mark only text+images.

🧠 In logical slide (4log), we have to mark only logical images.

🔄 Same process has to be followed for all screenshots.

## 🔪 Cutting 

For cutting, use the 🔗 Gyazo ([https://gyazo.com/en](https://gyazo.com/en)) and install it. 

Use the 🕹️ Ctrl + Shift + C keyboard shortcut to capture the screenshot. After cutting the images, enter the marking ID in the tracker sheet. Finally, update the tracker sheet with the marking ID and modified image ID, along with the Gyazo URL in the sheet provided below 👇 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=664811502](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=664811502) 🚫 RESTRICTED CONTENT

## Process:

1.  📷 For cutting use the Gyazo (Gyazo · Screenshot and video recorder for instantly clear sharing). We have to install the Gyazo.
2.  ⚙️ After installing Gyazo, we can select the shortcut in settings. For example, if we select (control shift c), we can use (Ctrl shift C) to capture the screenshot.
3.  ✍️ After cutting the images, we need to enter the marking id's in the tracker sheet.
4.  🔄 Update the tracker sheet with marking id and modified image id gyazo url.
5.  📝 Every project has a different tracker sheet. We have to enter the marking ids in that particular tracker sheet.
6.  💻 We have to insert the marking id in the images sub-sheet in the tracker sheet. We also need to update the Gyazo URL and the marking id (what we have done in marking), and we have to generate the image ids as well. For example, follow one of the trackers I have followed. Every project marking id has to follow like below: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ErTrTYA2g-HhN6s1PCu8J5xjOIAGPIBZ-tFGQyTBhm0/edit#gid=664811502](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ErTrTYA2g-HhN6s1PCu8J5xjOIAGPIBZ-tFGQyTBhm0/edit#gid=664811502) 🔒 RESTRICTED CONTENT

## Cleaning

🧹 Use the [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/e/) website for cleaning the images.

1.  We have to use the Photo Editor : Pixlr.com - free image editing online for cleaning the images 📷.
2.  After opening the above software, we have to insert the image in that software. We have to press `Ctrl+Shift` and select the Windows Select option in that software. After done editing, we have to save that image with an image id name 💾.
3.  Please go through the below video for better understanding of how to edit the images 📹.

## Image Insert Instructions

🖼️ Mark the g-blocks on the animation slides where images need to be inserted.

📝 For image insert instructions, we are using the marking for marking id and modified image id and use the animation ppt for locating the G blocks. Use the [template](https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?cid=1d5fee4885b5afbd&page=view&resid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!989&parId=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!756&app=PowerPoint) for instructions.

📊 Create image-insertion instructions in the G Sheet: [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=1613043066) (restricted content).

🖼️ Insert images into the g-blocks as per the image-insertion instructions in the Animation ppt.

📝 For inserting images, use the image insert instructions GSheet. We have to use the generic template for image insert instructions. Here is the genetic template: [template](https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?cid=1d5fee4885b5afbd&page=view&resid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!989&parId=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!756&app=PowerPoint)

**📝Note:** do not edit the generic template 🚫 🎞️ In the screenshots section, we have created a screenshots PPT, and in marking, we have created a marking PPT. Now, we have to create the animation PPT for image insert instructions.

🎯 Mark the G-blocks on the animation PPT where images and text need to be inserted. 📝 For image insert instructions, we are using the marking for marking ID and modified image ID. And use the animation PPT to locate the G-blocks and give the name like A1, A2... in every slide.

📄 Create image-insertion instructions in the G sheet. Every project has a separate tracker sheet, in that tracker, we have an image insert instructions subsheet. We have to give the image instructions in that subsheet. Here is the generic template for the tracker sheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=1613043066](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=1613043066) 🔒 RESTRICTED CONTENT

📌 For example, one of the tracker sheets (prani002), we can refer to this tracker sheet for better understanding: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ErTrTYA2g-HhN6s1PCu8J5xjOIAGPIBZ-tFGQyTBhm0/edit#gid=1613043066](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ErTrTYA2g-HhN6s1PCu8J5xjOIAGPIBZ-tFGQyTBhm0/edit#gid=1613043066) 🔒 RESTRICTED CONTENT

📝 In image insert instructions, we have to give the instructions in below sections:

-   From PPT: in this subsection, we have to give the marking PPT slide number that means from PPT, we are taking from marking PPT.
-   From slide ID: in this subsection, we have to give the marking slide ID (we are giving the instructions based on the marking slide ID, so we have to enter marking slide ID for every slide).
-   Operation: in this subsection, we have to enter the operation we are performing in the animation PPT (copy text, or image insert). For text, we will use copy text, and for the image, we will use insert image.
-   Object: if we have to insert the images in the animation PPT, we have to enter the object name. That means the object is, we have to enter the image ID.
-   To animation slide ID: in this, we have to enter the animation slide number, in which slide we are giving the instructions we have to enter the ID number like A1, A2 like that.
-   Location
-   Image-insert - review1: after done the image insertion, Anil sir will add the review in this subsection.
-   Image insertion: insert images into the G-blocks as per the image-insertion instructions in the Animation PPT. For inserting images, use the image insert instructions G sheet.
