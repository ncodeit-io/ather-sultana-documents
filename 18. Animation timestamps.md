# Animation Timestamps

### To add animation timestamps to your video transcripts, follow the steps below:

1.  Prepare the base transcripts and add them to the **recording-instructions** sheet.
2.  Once the original transcript is complete, add the animation timestamps based on the video and transcript.
3.  Give timestamps based on the audio/video file whenever the text appears, and note the time in the format of "00:00:10".
4.  Enter the recording instructions in the **recording-instr** subsheet. The generic template for the recording-instr sheet can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=544377454](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=544377454) RESTRICTED CONTENT.

Make sure to keep the animation timestamps up-to-date in the recording-instructions sheet to ensure accurate animations in your video.
