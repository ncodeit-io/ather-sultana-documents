# Postproduction workflow
## Phases of Post-Production Workflow
### Cleanup Phase
During the cleanup phase, common problems of the original video are usually fixed. The video will go through multiple cycles of review, fixing, correcting, and modifying to achieve the desired end result.
### Beautification Phase
During the beautification phase, new images, animations, titles, graphics will be added to make the video look professional. The video will also go through multiple cycles of review, fixing, correcting, and modifying to achieve the desired end result.

Each phase will have several cycles, which will be labeled as follows:

-   Cleanup cycle 1
-   Cleanup cycle 2
-   Cleanup cycle 3
-   Beautification cycle 1
-   Beautification cycle 2
-   Beautification cycle 3

### Create markdown for this above content without adding extra content**
1.  After the video is created, upload the unclean video to Vimeo's "01-pending-processing" folder.
2.  Import the video into any of the three workflow websites: Filestage.io, Wipster.io, or Vidhub.co.
3.  Upload the original video from Vimeo's "01-pending-processing" folder to one of the workflow websites.
4.  Identify all the points that need to be fixed as per the cleanup-cycle1 scenario given in this document on the workflow website.
5.  Upload the same video to WeVideo and make necessary changes for each review point in the workflow website. Leave comments in the workflow website's reply section.
6.  After all points are approved, upload the new version of the video from WeVideo to the workflow website.
7.  Proceed with the next review and repeat steps 5 and 6 until no more reviews are required.
8.  Work on the video using the workflow websites, WeVideo, image websites, and other software, and keep them uploaded to the workflow website.
9.  Once the final video is approved, upload it to Vimeo's "03-final-video" folder.
10.  Move the original video from Vimeo's "01-pending-processing" folder to "02-finished-processing".
### Scenarios for cleanup-cycle1

1.  **Scenario:** Scene on the video is not changing and there is no audio.
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** Check if the static scene can be removed completely or it needs to be cut down to 3 or 5 seconds.
        
2.  **Scenario:** Scene on the video is NOT changing. But there is audio from the trainer.
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** Check with the trainer. If the audio is relevant, the trainer will ask to keep it. If not relevant, the trainer may ask to trim the NOT changing part.
        
3.  **Scenario:** Installation is going on for a long time, and there is no audio from the trainer. Or trainer said something similar to "it's going to take some time."
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** Check with the trainer. Trainer may ask you to speed up the whole installation process so that the installation process is completed in about 5 seconds. Note: Speedup is NOT cutting the video. When we speedup the video, we keep everything but just show it really fast.
        
4.  **Scenario:** Trainer shifts through a lot of windows (alt+tab) while searching for a particular window.
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** Video should transition from one scene to the required scene directly. Remove all the unnecessary searching. Note: Make sure the audio continuity is not spoiled when cutting the video part.
        
5.  **Scenario:** Scene on the video, there is no screen. But audio is running.
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** Check with the trainer. If that screen is unnecessary, remove the screen.
        
6.  **Scenario:** Code is running for a long time while Installation is going, and no audio from a particular point till the end of the video.
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** If the code is running for a long time, check with the trainer. We can delete the long-time screen or we have to speed up the video in that part. If no audio in the entire video, we also have to check with the trainer. If only one part is going long-time, remove the screen after 5 seconds.
        
7.  **Scenario:** Installation is going on for a long time in some parts, but we have the total part.
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** Check with the trainer. If it is ok to speed up the video, we have to cut the part when it is taking a long time from and up to we need to cut that part. And speed up the video again added to the original video.
        
8.  **Scenario:** How to speed up the video in certain time.
    
    -   **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.
        
    -   **Action:** If the trainer has given a comment like speed up the part from one point to another point (START TO END), in WeVideo software, select that part and double click on that video part. We can see the speed-up options (last in the setting we can see the option) increase the value in that to speed up the video.

9. **Scenario:** Time length of video changes during cleanup-cycle1 in WeVideo software

    - **Identification:** Mark this point in workflow.

    - **Action:** Do not adjust the edited parts individually at first in WeVideo software. If we adjust the parts one by one, the original time length will be changed and it will be difficult to fix the comments accurately in WeVideo. So for each review point in workflow website, complete the necessary edits in WeVideo and once all the comments are addressed, adjust all the edited parts together to ensure the time length of the video is consistent.
