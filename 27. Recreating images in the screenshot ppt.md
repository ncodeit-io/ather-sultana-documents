### To recreate an image from a screenshot in powerpoint
1.  Capture a screenshot from the video you are watching.

2.  Open the **"Old screenshot ppt"** and paste the screenshot into it.

3.  Create a new PowerPoint presentation and rename it as **"Recreational ppt"**.
    
4.  Use the screenshots from "Old screenshot ppt"  as a reference to insert the necessary shapes and text boxes into the "Recreational ppt".
    
5.  You can use the shape tools to create rectangles, circles, arrows, and other shapes that resemble those in the old screenshot.
    
6.  Add any required text to the "Recreational ppt" based on the old screenshot. You can use the text box tool to add headings, subheadings, and body text.
    
7.  If necessary, split the "Recreational ppt" into 2 or 3 slides to make it more visually appealing and easier to understand.
    
8.  Once you have finished recreating the image in PowerPoint, save the "Recreational ppt" to ensure that all your changes are saved.
