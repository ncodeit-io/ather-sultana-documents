## 👉 Animation Vs Transition

## 🎬 Animation PPTx creation workflow

👀 watch the video (@pravalika should not watch this video )

🖊️ draw & record the architecture by hand (sheet by sheet) (This may not work first time) - It may take few tries - use proper stand to hold the mobile to record things - 🎥 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlsBLMw7VGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlsBLMw7VGE) (tear the A4 sheet into two halves and give numbers. Each half sheet should have slide number on left top corner. Make sure the number is clearly visible in video when starting each half sheet). Use numbers to represent images instead of actually drawing images. Then have a gsheet where each image number on the video drawing corresponds to an image. So that the animator can pick the correct image)

📤 Upload the video to vimeo 01-to-be-processed folder and post the link here

📝 create 2 PPTs, with name vid001-istio-architecture-instructions.pptx and vid001-istio-architecture-animation.pptx and share both of them

✍️ Write the instructions for first two slides and confirm to @pravalika so that she can start working

📝 finish the instructions for the rest of the slides and confirm to @pravalika

👩‍💻 @pravalika will finish draft1 (just draft, not perfect) of all the slides by around 2PM and update me for the review

🔍 While I am reviewing, she will continue with the improvements.

👩‍💻 @pravalika to finish the animation by 4 PM. If there are any doubts or if the instructions are not clear, she has to put it in comments on the instructions pptx and ping @Sathish.J

⏰ at 4 PM submit the final animation ppt for final review by me

⏰ by 4:30 PM I have to get back with modifications or final approval.

👍 If approved, by 5:30 PM add the template and upload to YouTube by 6 PM.

### Steps for creating animation ppts from existing videos🎞️

| Steps | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Step 1 | 📺 Watch the video. |
| Step 2 | 📝 Determine the number of slides required and make rough animations for each slide (draft1). |
| Step 3 | 🎬 Create the video for the first 50% of the slides. |
| Step 4 | 📄 Create instructions for the static slides of the first 50%. |
| Step 5 | 🎨 Create animation instructions for the static slides of the first 50%. |
| Step 6 | 🎞️ Create the animation. |
| Step 7 | 🎬 Create the video for the last 50% of the slides. |
| Step 8 | 📄 Create instructions for the static slides of the last 50%. |
| Step 9 | 🎨 Create animation instructions for the static slides of the last 50%. |
| Step 10 | 🎞️ Create the animation. |
| Step 11 | 🔍 Review and finalize the video. |
| Step 12 | 🎨 Apply thumbnail template. |
| Step 13 | 📤 Upload to YouTube. |


## General Guidelines / Recommendations:

- 🌞 It's recommended to use a light background unless there is a specific reason to use a dark one. Make this decision at the beginning of creating the animation ppt.

- 🎥 While recording the initial hand-drawn video, the drawing should be in landscape mode. Landscape will be similar to slide (this video is in portrait mode. It's wrong 👉 https://vimeo.com/user106656629/review/483395897/daf2d4b2b1).

- 🔄 While recording, it's possible that the direction of drawing and recording are not aligned properly. So, after recording is done, it should be changed to the correct direction using vlc player (or other) before uploading to the vimeo (this video 👉 https://vimeo.com/user106656629/review/483425492/b087126e8e should be rotated by 90 degrees anti-clockwise to make it easy for the person doing animation).

- 🔢 Instructions for any slide cannot go beyond that slide number. It confuses the animation creator. If there are too many instructions on a single slide, then the slide should be divided into two slides. This should be planned in the video. If you put too much info in a single slide, the instructions will be too much. This is happening because you are trying to cram too much content into a single slide to avoid redrawing.

- 🎨 Try to redraw part of one slide (just like the animator would do) into the next slide to keep the number of instructions limited.

## Instructions to  get the animation from existing images

| Stage | Instructions |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | 🔢 Give a cut-wise number to static images and send them to the trainer for review and recommendations. |
| 2     | 🎨 Cut the images into different parts as per the trainer's recommendations and convert them to vector image format. Upload the images to any drive and create a Google Sheet and put the details of images code-wise. |
| 3     | 🔄 Get instructions from the trainer to rearrange the image. Use the PowerPoint and rearrange the image based on the trainer's instructions. Send it to the trainer for review. |
| 4     | 🎙️ Get the audio record and animation instruction from the trainer and apply animation to rearranged images. Send for review to the trainer. |
| 5     | 🎬 Do the pre and post-production work and upload to YouTube. |



# Marking of Images - General Guidelines

There are 4 different categories of markings:

🔴 **1txt** - Marking of text - in RED color boxes. With 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, ... all starting with 1.

🟢 **2img** - Marking of images - in GREEN color boxes. With 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, ... all starting with 2.

🔵 **3tximg** - Marking of text + images - in BLUE color boxes - with 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, ... all starting with 3.

🟡 **4logi** - Marking of Logical Blocks - in YELLOW color boxes - with 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, ... all starting with 4.

Apart from this, each slide will have the category of marking at the top right corner of that slide.

When marking a new image, we have to copy the correct slide and then insert the image into the slide, then start the marking.

A video tutorial demonstrating how to do these markings is available at 👉 https://youtu.be/Z_ffUmq5UvA

The current template file for marking images is "rvid001-generic-template-for-marking-images-v1.pptx" and can be found on OneDrive.

## 🔍 Using Professional Powerpoint templates and InfoGraphics 🖥️

Professional Powerpoint templates are pre-created templates by good designers that we can use to enhance the look and feel of our presentation. 

Check out 🌐 [https://graphicriver.net/popular_item/by_category?category=presentation-templates%2Fpowerpoint-templates&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_qD_BRDiARIsANjZ2LDqrlBXPiREMU1vqQDxkLj0xUK6O0IJSRYwcBqDcuak-CMFg8Ns0dEaAlMbEALw_wcB](https://graphicriver.net/popular_item/by_category?category=presentation-templates%2Fpowerpoint-templates&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_qD_BRDiARIsANjZ2LDqrlBXPiREMU1vqQDxkLj0xUK6O0IJSRYwcBqDcuak-CMFg8Ns0dEaAlMbEALw_wcB) 🌐 

They are basically slides that we can:

1️⃣ Copy the slides from the template to our own PPT file.

2️⃣ Modify the pre-created slides slightly to convert them into what we need for our own PPT.

3️⃣ Use infographics (such as arrows, boxes, banners, etc.) that we can copy/paste into our own PPT.

We have already purchased the following two bundles for our internal use. Check with the project manager to get these copies onto your own laptop:
