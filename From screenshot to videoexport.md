- Use the below template for instructions:  
[https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?cid=1d5fee4885b5afbd&page=view&resid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!989&parId=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!756&app=PowerPoint](https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?cid=1d5fee4885b5afbd&page=view&resid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!989&parId=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD!756&app=PowerPoint)

- And use the animation ppt for locate the G blocks and give the name like A1,A2â€¦.in every slide.
        
2.  Create image-insertion instructions in the g sheet.  
- Every project has separate tracker sheet in that tracker. 
- We have image insert instructions subsheet ,we have to give the image instructionsin that subsheet. 
- Here is the generic template for tracker sheet  
        [![](https://developers.google.com/drive/images/drive_icon.png)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=1613043066](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfPKgJFbR31RLrVjoaoVGNQ8i7mRgN8lc-srCtVr7hQ/edit#gid=1613043066)`RESTRICTED CONTENT`
